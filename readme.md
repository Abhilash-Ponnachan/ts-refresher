TypeScript (TS) Primer
====================
In this article we shall take a quick tour of the fundamental concepts in TS and how to apply them.
## Whats is TS?
TypeScript (TS) is a strict superset of JavaScript (JS) that adds on support for strong typing and advanced langauge features (such as interfaces, generics, decorators and many more). This massivley improves the expressibility of JS and promotes better structured code that is easier to maintain at scale.  The _'tsc'_ compiler transpiles TS down to pure JS (ES5 by default, but can also be made to target ES6) which may be executed either in the browser or in a Node.js runtime.  

## Setup Environment
The first step is to setup a development environment to play with. 
- **Installing TS**  
    The easiest way to install TS is to do it via _NPM_. This means we need to have _Node_ & _NPM_ installed.
    ```bash
    $ npm -g install typescript
    ```
    This should install TS in a global scope. On Windows, by default the installed path would be -
    ```bash
    $ where tsc

    $HOME/AppData/Roaming/npm/tsc
    $HOME/AppData/Roaming/npm/tsc.cmd
    ``` 
    We can check the installed TS version either by -
    ```bash
    $ tsc --version

    Version 2.8.1
    ```
    or listing the global _NPM_ packages -
    ```bash
    $ npm -g --depth=0 ls

    $HOME/AppData/Roaming/npm/
    +-- browserify@16.2.3
    +-- create-react-app@1.5.2
    `-- typescript@2.8.1
    ```
    This is the version I have installed at the time of writing this article.  

- **IDE - VS Code**  
    Because TS ultimately gets reduced to JS, it is possible to use any text editor and JS runtime. However for a productive development experince we shall be using VS Code, which comes with builtin support for TS such as deep intellisence, understanding type-declarationfiles, and integrated debugging. We can configure a TS project in VS Code with some minimal configuration. 

- **Manifest file - tsconig.json**  
    Typically the first step is to create a TS project configuration file called _tsconfig.json_. This file defines various options to be used, such as _compiler options_, _included/excluded files_ etc.  
    This file can be created manually and some basic standard options typed in (or copy-pasted from the web). Though now the better way to do this is using the _--init_ switch on the TS compiler.
    ```bash
    $ tsc --init
    ```
    This should create a _tsconfig.json_ file with a lot of options (most of which are commented out). We will just focus on the essentials for now - 
    ```javascript
    {
    "compilerOptions": {
        /* Basic Options */
        "target": "es5", /* Specify ECMAScript target version*/
        "module": "commonjs", /* Specify module code generation: 'none', 'commonjs', 'amd', 'system', 'umd', 'es2015', or 'ESNext'. */
        "sourceMap": true, /* Generates corresponding '.map' file. */
        // "lib": [], /* Specify library files to be included in the compilation. */
        // "declaration": true, /* Generates corresponding '.d.ts' file. */
        // "outFile": "./", /* Concatenate and emit output to single file. */
        // "outDir": "./",  /* Redirect output structure to the directory. */
    
        /* Strict Type-Checking Options */
        "strict": true, /* Enable all strict type-checking options. */
    
        /* Additional Checks */
        
        /* Module Resolution Options */
        "esModuleInterop": true, /* Enables emit interoperability between CommonJS and ES Modules via creation of namespace objects for all imports. Implies 'allowSyntheticDefaultImports'. */

        /* Source Map Options */

        /* Experimental Options */
        // "experimentalDecorators": true,        /* Enables experimental support for ES7 decorators. */
    }
    }
    ```  
    _Note that I have removed a lot of the commented lines for brevity._  
    With this VS Code can provide rich syntax highlighting and editing experince for the TS project.  

- **Trying it out**  
    At this stage we can actually try writing some simple TS code, compiling and running it. So we make a simple TS file _'basics.ts'_ with some _Hello World_ code - 
    ```typescript
    class Startup{
        public static main(args: any): number{
            console.log("Hello world!");
            return 0;
        }
    }
    Startup.main(null);
    ```
    A rudimentary class with a static method that prints to the console.
    To build and see the output we would do the following -
    ```bash
    $ tsc basics.ts
    $ node basics.js
    Hello World!
    ```
    The TS file gets compiled to JS and, then we can run it using Node.  

- **Build Task**  
    Now, even though we can manually build the _.ts_ file to JS from the commandline, this can become tedious as the codebase grows. Also as we shall see later we would want to run it directly from VS Code if we want to _debug_ the code.  
    We can configure VS Code to build the code using _Tasks_.  
    In almost any software development loop we would use tools for _linting_, _testing_, _building_, _packaging_, and _deploying_ (linters : ESLint, TSLint; build-tools : Ant, MSBuild, Make, Rake, Gulp, Grunt). As an IDE it is importnat to be able to execute these tools and analyze their results from within VS Code. This is what _tasks_ allow us to do.
  - To configure a _task_ within VS Code we can use the _"Command Palette"_ (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+p)
    - Start typing "Configure Default Build Task" and select that optoin. This will give us a dropdown with the options as shown - 
    ![config-build-task](config-build-task.png)
    In this case VS Code has detected that this is a TS project from the **tsconfig.json** file.  
  _Note that we can also configure other "Custom Tasks" if we need, for example to execute some shell scripts._

  - A shorter way is to directly invoke _"Run Build Task"_(Ctrl+Shift+b). It will again give us an option to select the _task to run_, and if it is the first time it will configure the build task.

  - **tsc: build** - Explicit build  
  If we select this option, it will create a **tasks.json** file, in a hidden folder **.vscode** within the project. This contains the configuration information for the behaviour of the _build task_.
  ```json
    {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "tasks": [
          {
              "type": "typescript",
              "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json",
              "problemMatcher": [
                  "$tsc"
              ],
              "group": {
                  "kind": "build",
                  "isDefault": true
              }
          }
      ]
  }
  ```  
  The attributes in this file inform VS Code what the build behaviour should be.
  This is an explicit build option and we invoke it everytime we want to build using the "Run Build Task" (Ctrl+Shift+b) command.  
  This will build the TS files to JS without us having to invoke the compiler from the commandline.

  - **tsc: watch** - Build on change  
  If we want VS Code to automatically build everytime we modify and save a _".ts"_ file, wqe can configure the build to be in **watch** mode. We choose the **tsc: watch** option and this will create a **tasks.json** that looks like -
  ```json
  {
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "tasks": [
          {
              "type": "typescript",
              "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json",
              "option": "watch",
              "problemMatcher": [
                  "$tsc-watch"
              ],
              "group": {
                  "kind": "build",
                  "isDefault": true
              }
          }
      ]
  }
  ```  
  In this we can see that we are running the **"tsc"** compiler with the **"watch"** option. Now if we _run the build task_ (Ctrl+Sift+b), the task will start in **watch** mode and every time we save a change the TS files it will compile automatically.  
  _We can stop the running task when we are done or if we choose to._

- **Debug the code**  
    Running the JS file from the commandline is all fine, but when we need to debug it is better to do that from the IDE. To enable this, we do _"Start Debugging"_ (F5) and again VS Code will not know exactly what to do, so it prompts us to choose a runtime / debug-envirinment:
    ![choose-debug-env](select-debug-process.png) 
    _Note that VS Code comes with support for the Node.js runtime, but we can install debuggers for other runtimes such as Python, C++, C#, Chrome etc. if we need._  
    In this case we choose _Node.js_ and this will now create an additional file **launch.json** in the hidden _".vscode"_ folder. This file contains the configuration information to launch the applicaion in debug mode.
    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "node",
                "request": "launch",
                "name": "Launch Program",
                "program": "${workspaceFolder}\\basics.js",
                "outFiles": [
                    "${workspaceFolder}/**/*.js"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
    The _"type"_ indicates what the runtime environment is, _"request"_ indicates if it should _launch_ or _attach_ and the _"program"_ points to the entry-point file.  
    Now we can set a breakpoint and start debugging (F5), step over, step into, watch and modify variables etc. as we would do in any other IDE.
    ![breakpoint](breakpoint.png)
    
    This also changes the _"sourceMap"_ attribute value in the _"tsconfig.json"_ - 
    ```json
        "sourceMap": true,  
    ```
    This creates the _"*.js.map"_ files (on build), that enables the debugger to map execution point to a location in the source code.

    - **"launch" v/s "attach"**  
        VS Code gives two debugging modes, each for a different workflow - _"launch"_ and _"attach"_.   
         - When we want the debugger to _"attach"_ to a running process, like we would do to debug a _browser app_, we use the _"attach"_ mode. The attributes for this configuration would indicate the details of the process to attach to.
         - When we need the process to be launched first, like when debugging server-side applications we specify the _"launch"_ mode. For
